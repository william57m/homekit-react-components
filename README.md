# HomeKit React Components

List of React Component mimicating HomeKit components from the Home application (iOS, MacOS).


## Installation

```
npm install homekit-react-components
```


## Usage

1. Wrap your app with the theme provider. For now, no default theme are provided so you will need to inject the theme yourself.

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';
import { theme } from 'homekit-react-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <MyApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

2. Use any components in your code ðŸ¤—

```js
const [ on, setOn ] = useState(true);

<LightCard
  name="My Light"
  on={on}
  onToggle={() => setOn(prevState => !prevState)}
/>
```
